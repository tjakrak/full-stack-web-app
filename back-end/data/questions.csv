Trust,Secure,Organizational Security,Authentication,"Create Salesforce users based on individuals, not personas. Salesforce provides builtin auditing features that are most effective when there is a 1:1 mapping between Salesforce user accounts and entities accessing Salesforce with a user account. Shared user accounts decrease the usefulness of builtin auditing, create additional security risks, increase the potential damage stemming from account breaches, and hinder your ability to create effective authorization schemes. This includes user accounts for integration users.",Are Salesforce users based on individuals rether than personas?
Trust,Secure,Organizational Security,Authentication,Secure UIbased access scenarios. Most human users require some kind of UIbased access (often called login access) for a Salesforce org. Salesforce provides several layers of protection for these login scenarios.,"What are the password policies? Usernames and passwords are a primary target for cybercriminals seeking to gain unauthorized access to applications. Configuring password policies is a baseline step to protecting login access. This step alone is not sufficient, however, as password policies can be overridden on a peruser basis within Salesforce."
Trust,Secure,Organizational Security,Authentication,Secure UIbased access scenarios. Most human users require some kind of UIbased access (often called login access) for a Salesforce org. Salesforce provides several layers of protection for these login scenarios.,"Is Multifactor authentication (MFA) enabled? Salesforce requires MFA for all UIbased user logins. In MFA scenarios, after successfully entering a username and password, users must also provide an additional type of identification, or factor, to verify their identity. This additional factor is usually in a physical format, like a mobile device, security key, or biometric marker. MFA is an essential defense against credential leaks and bruteforce attacks."

Salesforce provides several layers of protection for these login scenarios.,"What are the Postlogin steps, if any? For some use cases, you might want your users to complete additional steps before they�re allowed to access your system. In such cases, you can use custom login flows to route users through an additional set of process steps before they are granted access to your system. Examples include:

Trust,Secure,Organizational Security,Authorization,"Think about what users can access in terms of personas, not individuals. Thinking of authorization (or security in general) in terms of individual users will not set your system up to scale and evolve. A better approach is to design for and manage personas that represent groups of users. It�s important to recognize that Salesforce solutions architected to be secure use individuals for authentication, but personas for authorization. As you build your security model, specify the security configuration appropriate to each security persona. Determining access (and privileges) based on personas gives you the ability to control access at a granular level, and reduces the amount of refactoring involved in maintaining your system over time. Include the security personas you define in your design standards and documentation.",Do user personas exist for authorization purposes?
Trust,Secure,Organizational Security,Authorization,"Use permission sets and permission set groups to control metadata access for users. Use permission sets and permission set groups to control what metadata users can access and what they can do with that metadata.

Include this access in your design design standards and documentation.",Are permission groups and set groups used to control metadata access for users?
Trust,Secure,Organizational Security,Authorization,"Use OWDs and sharing to control data access for users. Because data and metadata are distinct entities in Salesforce, access controls for data and metadata are also distinct.

For more about managing OAuth tokens, see Session Management.",Do OAuth scopes control access for connected apps?
Trust,Secure,Organizational Security,Authorization,"Follow the principle of least privilege. The principle of least privilege (PoLP) is an approach to security in which users are assigned the minimal permissions necessary to carry out their work. To follow this principle, structure your permission sets to be granular and modular. This will enable you to create sophisticated access controls with permission set groups and to precisely manage permissions, which can be muted, set to expire, and more. Orient the functional groupings of your system to business capabilities to define granular permissions and effective permission set groups. Remember that permissions apply to metadata access in Salesforce. For details about configuring PoLP for Salesforce data access, see Sharing and Visibility.",Are you following the principle of least privilege?
Trust,Secure,Organizational Security,Authorization,"Minimize use of profiles and migrate any access controls out of profiles. Profiles provide the ability to limit access to login IP ranges, login hours, and specific features tied to the legacy Salesforce Classic user interface (specifically default record types and page layout assignments). Any functionality not directly tied to these features should be migrated to equivalent functionality in permission sets and permission set groups. Functionality in your profiles tied to Salesforce Classic UI features should be targeted for remediation.",Are access controls migrated from profiles and profiles minimized?

Trust,Secure,Session Security,Threat Detection and Response,"Establish regular audit reviews. Auditing is a key part of detecting anomalous changes that may not be picked up as a realtime threat. Consider, for example, a user with legitimate access who deletes a small number of records every day for an extended period. Because this user has valid login credentials, has proper authorization to delete records, and is not deleting many records all at once, the activity isn�t likely to be detected as a threat in real time. For an audit team reviewing a report of user activities, however, the trend of a single user deleting an excessive number of records over time would be clearer to see and easier to respond to.

Trust,Secure,Data Security,Sharing and Visibility,"Choose the simplest path to applying the principle of least privilege. As you apply the principle of least privilege in designing sharing and visibility schemes, do so in the most straightforward way. Avoid overengineered data restrictions and sharing schemes, which can cause downstream issues for system maintainability, scalability, and adaptability. Instead, take advantage of the flexible, layered data sharing in Salesforce, which enables you to configure finegrained rules for user access at the data level.","Have you applied the principle of least privilege in designing sharing and visibility schemes, do so in the most straightforward way?"
Trust,Secure,Data Security,Sharing and Visibility,"Set internal organizationwide defaults (OWDs) to Public Read Only, unless your business deals with sensitive data � then use Private. OWDs control the level of �least� privilege users will have at the data level. You cannot restrict access below the level of your OWD. For this reason, it may seem like choosing an OWD of Private is the optimal approach in every use case. However, in practice, users across the business can often end up inadvertently replicating a more permissive OWD through complex sharing schemes. Additionally, Private OWDs can cause users to create duplicate data. Sharing calculations (and recalculations) may take a significant amount of time to complete depending on data volume and parentchild or ownership skew � Private OWDs exacerbate this. CRUD permissions and fieldlevel visibility aren�t actually controlled by OWDs. Only choose an OWD of Private when it is justified by business needs � most often, such justifications will be related to compliance.",Are internal organizationwide defaults (OWDs) set to Public Read Only for public data or Private for sensitive data.
Trust,Secure,Data Security,Sharing and Visibility,"Set external organizationwide defaults (OWDs) to Private, unless you have a compelling business reason to allow greater access. External OWDs apply to users accessing Salesforce data from Experience Cloud sites, portals, and so on.

Local data storage means that data is stored at rest in the country; of course, compliance issues can arise when data is transferred out of the country through standard interfaces. For example, creating and maintaining records locally but replicating them to a data warehouse in another country for reporting will violate data residency laws. If you work for a global business with crossregional reporting requirements, first aggregate your data within the country where it�s stored, remove all information that could potentially identify the citizens associated with it, and then replicate only the aggregate information.

Trust,Reliable,Performance,Throughput Optimization,"Favor asynchronous processing. The Salesforce Platform uses transaction contexts to control for data integrity and limit the potential for runaway code to dominate compute resources. (For more on this topic, see transactions in Architecture Basics.) For this reason, using asynchronous (async) processing where possible can help minimize potential bottlenecks in synchronous execution contexts. (For more on designing transactions, see transaction handling.) Using async compute is not a cure for every kind of performance issue, and you�ll need to take latency into consideration when incorporating async processes. Certain platform capabilities, such as queueable Apex, may increase latency during traffic spikes because messages wait longer in a queue. Depending on the use case, you may decide to tolerate a potential decrease in responsiveness, in order to maintain (or improve) throughput. In other cases, increased latency may not be acceptable.",
Trust,Reliable,Performance,Throughput Optimization,"Always use bulkification. Bulkification, at a high level, means carrying out operations against collections. Often, discussions of bulkification for Salesforce focus on streamlining data operations against collections. (For more on this, see Planning for Scale). However, bulkification at a system level involves more than just data operations. Tasks like callouts or complex computations should also be considered candidates for bulkification. A principal benefit of proper bulkification is that it reduces overhead by enabling multiple operations to be executed with one request, rather than executing a single request per operation. (For more on this topic, see Bulk Operations).",Are operations bulkified (streamlined against collections with callouts/computations)?
Trust,Reliable,Performance,Throughput Optimization,"Use SOSL for searches and treat SOQL like a data operation. It may seem obvious that using overly complex SOQL statements will increase the amount of time it takes the system to retrieve records. Less obvious, however, is the fact that even using SOQL adds overhead to the underlying relational database that slows down processing. Especially if using text or wildcard criteria, locating records via SOSL will be more performant and efficient because it uses the platform�s search engine, which is optimized for full-text indexing and universal searches. To optimize record retrieval patterns, ensure your design standards specify when to use SOSL to find data in your system, and how to use SOQL for efficient data operations.

Trust,Reliable,Scalability,Data Volume Management,"Distribute ownership of records. Avoid ownership skew by ensuring no single user or queue (or all the members of a single role or public group) owns more than 10,000 records from the same object. �Parking� data with a �dummy user� is a practice that often leads to ownership skew. If you encounter this issue, be mindful of the impact this will have on sharing calculations. If you cannot redistribute records to relieve the ownership skew, avoid assigning the dataowning user to a role. If the org sharing model requires a role assignment, place the dataowning user in a distinct role at the top of the sharing hierarchy. Do not allow for frequent or unplanned changes in that user�s role, as any changes will have significant performance impacts due to sharing recalculations. Keep that user out of public groups that could be referenced in any sharing rules.",Is ownership of records adequately distributed?
